## 📖 Project Overview
Flooding is a recurring environmental challenge in Nassarawa, Kaduna South LGA. This project focuses on **drainage mapping, watershed delineation, and flood risk analysis** using **Geospatial Technology (GIS & Remote Sensing)**.  

The goal is to:
- Identify and map drainage networks and watershed boundaries.
- Classify stream orders using hydrological modeling.
- Analyze flood-prone areas based on drainage patterns and proximity to the River Kaduna.
- Provide a spatial decision-support tool for flood control planning.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset and Inputs
- **Topographic maps** (contours & elevation data).
- **Satellite imagery** (for land cover and hydrological features).
- **Field data** (ground-truthing of drainage and settlement areas).
- **Hydrological layers** (drainage buffer zones, river networks).

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Software
- **ArcGIS Pro / ArcGIS Online** – Spatial analysis, watershed delineation, buffer analysis.
- **QGIS** – Open-source GIS visualization and editing.
- **AutoCAD Map / Cartographic tools** – Map design and presentation.
- **Excel** – Data handling for survey and tabular analysis.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition** – Collect DEM, satellite imagery, and field data.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Georeferencing, digitizing drainage, and contour extraction.  
3. **Hydrological Analysis** – Stream ordering, watershed delineation, and drainage density.  
4. **Buffer Analysis** – 30m buffer around drainage channels for flood risk assessment.  
5. **Map Production** – Final cartographic output at **scale 1:5,000** with contour and drainage overlays.

## 🗺️ Map Output
The final map includes:
- River Kaduna and tributaries.
- Indexed and intermediate contours.
- Buildings and settlement patterns.
- Drainage buffer zones (30m).
- Stream order classification (Order 1, 2, 3).  

**Scale:** *1:5,000*  
**Conversion:** 1 cm = 50 meters

## 🚀 Applications
- Flood control planning.  
- Urban and regional planning in Kaduna State.  
- Environmental management and watershed protection.  
- Policy formulation for disaster risk reduction.
